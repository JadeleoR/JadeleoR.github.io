            <p class="text">Happy 8 months Jade, I really really love you. You constantly make me become a better person, so I want to make something special for you.
                Making letters isn't my best attribute, so I wanted to make something for you with the skills I have now, I hope you like it.

            <p class="text">
                You were able to make me smile at a time when I thought I wasn't capable of doing so, that's when I realised I had a crush on you. 
                After that I started falling more and more in love with you. The way you smiled, laughed, sat with me, walked, stared at me. You constantly
                give me butterflies, making me feel things I've never felt before. I can say confidently what I feel with you is love, and I don't ever want 
                to stop feeling it.

            <p class="text">
                We constantly stayed up together, you never said no to come over, always asked me to go everywhere with you. Going out late at night. 
                You made a kid who never left their room, always got burnt out when he left, and had no social life whatsoever, enjoy being outside with you. You 
                made me touch grass.

                You're the first real person who's ever made me feel included, and person who I want to include in family activities. 
                Something which I always wanted to do. Having  you around has been the best thing for me, always keeping me in check, reassuring me 
                of my goals, having deep talks with you are my favourite. You let me be myself around you, even when you call me weird and annoying 
                I don't want to stop being me when I'm with you.

            <p class="text">
                Finishing our first year of college together has me excited for the next few years together. Even though we aren't the best with money
                right now, having you by my side telling me I'm doing a good job has me confident that I can get a good future. I want to have a great summer
                with you, and spend the rest of our lives together. Even if I struggle to show how much I like you, when I don't say the things you expect me to,
                I am always thinking of you, trying to find ways to make you happy, you make me whole, and I want to make sure we're happy together, no matter
                what happens. I love you Jade.
